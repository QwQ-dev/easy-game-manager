### Easy Game Manager

A replacement for [GameManager](https://github.com/BirdsNS/GameManager), developed with Spring Boot.

### Getting Started

1. Copy the `resources/server-configs` folder to the same directory as the JAR file.
2. Run the application to generate `config.yml`.
3. Customize the thread pool configuration in `config.yml`.

### Server Configuration

To configure servers, duplicate the `example.yml` file and make changes as needed. Detailed explanations are provided in
the comments within the file.

### API Reference

For detailed API information, refer to the `me.qwqdev.egm.controller.ServerControllerInterface` class.

1. Always call the `updateServerConfigs` API to load configurations when starting the application.
2. Ensure all instances of `Process` are properly closed before shutting down.
